<h2><span class="small">WELCOME TO YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK</span></h2>
<p>In bidding you welcome the National Park Service asks you to remember that you
are visiting a great playground that belongs in part to you, and that while you are
at liberty to go anywhere in the park with perfect freedom, you owe it to yourself
and to your fellow citizens not to do anything that will injure the trees, the wild animals
or birds, or any of the natural features of the park.</p>
<p>The park regulations are designed for the protection of the natural beauties and
scenery as well as for the comfort and convenience of visitors. The following synopsis
is for the general guidance of visitors, who are requested to assist the administration by
observing the rules.</p>
<h3>RULES AND REGULATIONS
<br />(Briefed)</h3>
<p><b>Fires.</b>&mdash;Light carefully and in designated places. Extinguish COMPLETELY
before leaving camp even for temporary absence. Do not guess your fire is out&mdash;KNOW
IT. Do not throw burning tobacco or matches on road or trail sides.</p>
<p><b>Camps.</b>&mdash;Register at camp entrance. Keep your camp clean. Burn all combustible
material and place all garbage in cans provided. Camp at least 25 feet from other
tents, buildings, or water hydrants.</p>
<p><b>Trash.</b>&mdash;Do not throw paper, lunch refuse, kodak cartons or paper, chewing-gum
paper, or other trash on roads, trails, or elsewhere. Ball up and carry until you
can burn in camp or place in receptacle.</p>
<p><b>Trees, Flowers, and Animals.</b>&mdash;The destruction, injury, or disturbance in
any way of the trees, flowers, birds, or animals is prohibited. Dead and fallen wood,
except sequoia, may be used for firewood.</p>
<p><b>Noises.</b>&mdash;Be quiet in camp after others have gone to bed. Many people come here
for rest.</p>
<p><b>Automobiles.</b>&mdash;Speed limit in park is 35 miles per hour. Drive carefully at all
times. Keep cut-outs closed. Obey park traffic rules. Secure automobile permit,
fee $2.</p>
<p><b>Park Rangers.</b>&mdash;The rangers are here to help and advise you as well as to enforce
the regulations. When in doubt ask a ranger.</p>
<p><b>Warning About Bears.</b>&mdash;Do not feed the bears from the hand; they are wild
animals and may bite, strike, or scratch you. They will not harm you if not fed
at close range. Bears will enter or break into automobiles if food that they can smell
is left inside. They will also rob your camp of unprotected food supplies, especially
in the early spring or late fall when food is scarce. It is best to suspend food supplies
in a box well out of their reach between two trees. Bears are especially hungry in the
fall of the year and serious loss or damage may result if food is left accessible to them.</p>
<p>All articles lost or found should be reported to the ranger headquarters in the
New Village, to any ranger station, or to the offices at Camp Curry, Yosemite Lodge,
or the Ahwahnee. Persons should leave their name and address so that articles which
are not claimed within 60 days may be turned over to the finders.</p>
<p>Suggestions, complaints, or comments regarding any phase of park management,
including the operation of camp grounds, hotels, and attitude of employees, should
be communicated immediately to the superintendent.</p>

<h2><span class="small">WHAT TO DO AND SEE IN YOSEMITE</span></h2>
<p>Here are a few suggestions to help you plan your time in Yosemite to
best advantage. This is a <b>summer schedule</b>&mdash;in winter see special
programs posted on bulletin boards at hotels.</p>
<p>Do not hurry through Yosemite&mdash;take the time to at least visit all points
of interest in the Valley and do not leave the park without seeing the
Mariposa Grove of Big Trees and the wonderful panoramic view from
Glacier Point.</p>
<h3>GENERAL</h3>
<p>Visit the Yosemite Museum, located in the New Village, open 8 a. m.
to 5 p. m. Interesting exhibits of the geology, Indians, early history, trees,
flowers, birds, and mammals of Yosemite. Wild-flower garden and
demonstrations of native Indian life in back of museum. Short talks on
geology of the Valley given several times each day. Library, information
desk, and headquarters for nature guide service. Maps and booklets.</p>
<p>Take the auto caravan tour of the Valley floor with your own car,
starting from the museum at 9:30 a. m. and 2 p. m. A ranger-naturalist
leads the caravan and explains the interesting features of Yosemite on this
free trip of about 2 hours around the Valley, every day except Sunday and
holidays.</p>
<p>A daily tour of the Valley in open stages is an ideal way to see the most
in a short time. Inquire at Camp Curry, Yosemite Lodge, or the Ahwahnee
for rates and schedules on stage transportation.</p>
<p>Visitors desiring to make an unescorted tour of the Valley should take
the Valley floor loop road, stopping at points of interest which are signed.
See detailed map of Valley. See the wonderful view of the whole expanse
of the Valley from the east portal of the 4,233-foot tunnel, a short, easy
drive of 1&frac12; miles up the new Wawona Road, just west of Bridalveil Fall.</p>
<p>Take trips afield with a ranger-naturalist. See posted daily schedules.</p>
<p>During July and August a naturalist leads a party once each week on
a 7-day hiking trip through the spectacular high-mountain regions of the
park, stopping each night at a High Sierra camp. See bulletins posted at
hotels and camps.</p>
<p>Visit the fish hatchery at Happy Isles.</p>
<p>See the sunrise at Mirror Lake.</p>
<p>Camp-fire entertainments every night except Sunday in Camp 14.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_VI">VI</div>
<p>Outdoor entertainments every evening at 8 o&rsquo;clock at Camp Curry.</p>
<p>See the fire fall each night at 9 o&rsquo;clock from the upper end of the Valley
or at Camp Curry.</p>
<p>Bears are fed every evening at 9:30 o&rsquo;clock about 2 miles west of the Old
Village.</p>
<p>Dances every evening except Sunday at 9 o&rsquo;clock at Camp Curry.</p>
<p><b>See complete programs of weekly events which are posted at
camps, hotels, and lodges.</b></p>
<p><b>Visit Yosemite both summer and winter&mdash;The all-year highway
is open every day of the year.</b> Keep your Yosemite automobile
permit&mdash;it is good for the entire year. Each season has its particular
charm.</p>
<p><b>In spring</b>&mdash;booming waterfalls, rushing streams, green meadows.</p>
<p><b>In summer</b>&mdash;ideal camping, High Sierra trips, good fishing.</p>
<p><b>In autumn</b>&mdash;beautiful autumn coloring, ideal Indian summer weather.</p>
<p><b>In winter</b>&mdash;a different Yosemite, with snow mantling trees and cliffs,
all-winter sports&mdash;skating, skiing, tobogganing.</p>
<h3>1-DAY MOTOR TRIPS</h3>
<p><b>To Glacier Point.</b>&mdash;Thirty miles (about 1&frac12; hours) each way. Paved
highway to Chinquapin, 14 miles, and good oiled road from there to Glacier
Point. Leave the Valley on the Wawona Road just west of Bridalveil
Fall. Visit Sentinel Dome, elevation 8,117 feet&mdash;a one-half mile drive
and short climb from the main road above Glacier Point. Wonderful
panorama of the High Sierra and the Valley. Camp ground and hotel
at Glacier Point.</p>
<p><b>To the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees.</b>&mdash;Thirty-five miles (about
1&frac12; hours) each way. Paved highway. Leave the Valley just west of
Bridalveil Fall; go through the 4,233-foot tunnel; wonderful views along
this road. Hotels, camp ground, garage, golf, saddle horses at Wawona,
27 miles from the Valley. See the oldest and largest living things in the
world and the tunnel tree through which cars may be driven. There is a
new hotel and good camp ground at the Big Trees.</p>
<p><b>To Hetch Hetchy Dam and Valley.</b>&mdash;Thirty-eight miles (about
2 hours) each way. Good, oiled, mountain road. Leave the Valley at
El Capitan station; one-way road for first 4 miles, and cars must leave on
the even hours-6 to 6:25 a. m., 8 to 8:25 a. m., 10 to 10:25 a. m., and so on
throughout the day. See the Tuolumne Grove of Big Trees and visit the
fire lookout tower, 1&frac12; miles west of Crane Flat.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Also Daily Stages to These Scenic Points; Inquire at Hotels.</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_VII">VII</div>
<h3>1-DAY HIKES FROM VALLEY&mdash;DISTANCES GIVEN ONE WAY</h3>

for horses.</p>
<p>A taxi service is available for all hikers, to and from the start of trails in
the upper half of the Valley, at 25 cents per person. Telephones are
available at base of all trails.</p>
<p>All hikers are warned to stay on designated trails&mdash;<b>do not take short
cuts across zigzags</b>; you may dislodge rocks that will injure someone below.
On the long hikes to the rim of the Valley, start early when it is cool and
get back before dark. Hikers going into isolated sections of the park or off
the regular trails should register at the chief ranger&rsquo;s office before starting.</p>
<p>Accurate information on roads, trails, fishing, and camping, and maps
of the park are available without charge at park headquarters, the museum,
and ranger stations.</p>

<h1 title="">YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK</h1>
<p>The Yosemite National Park is much greater, both in area and beauty,
than is generally known. Nearly all Americans who have not explored
it consider it identical with the far-famed Yosemite Valley. The
fact is that the Valley is only a very small part, indeed, of this glorious
public pleasure ground. It was established October 1, 1890, but its
boundary lines have been changed several times since then. It now has
an area of 1,176.16 square miles, 752,744 acres.</p>
<p>This magnificent pleasure land lies on the west slope of the Sierra
Nevada about 200 miles due east of San Francisco. The crest of the
range is its eastern boundary as far south as Mount Lyell. The rivers
which water it originate in the everlasting snows. A thousand icy streams
converge to form them. They flow west through a marvelous sea of peaks,
resting by the way in hundreds of snow-bordered lakes, romping through
luxuriant valleys, rushing turbulently over rocky heights, swinging in
and out of the shadows of mighty mountains.</p>
<p>The Yosemite Valley occupies 8 square miles out of a total of 1,176
square miles in the Yosemite National Park. The park above the rim is
less celebrated principally because it is less known. It is less known principally
because it was not opened to the public by motor road until 1915.
Now several roads and 700 miles of trail make much of the spectacular
high-mountain region of the park easily accessible.</p>
<p>For the rest, the park includes, in John Muir&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;the headwaters
of the Tuolumne and Merced Rivers, two of the most songful streams in
the world; innumerable lakes and waterfalls and smooth silky lawns;
the noblest forests, the loftiest granite domes, the deepest ice-sculptured
canyons, the brightest crystalline pavements, and snowy mountains soaring
into the sky twelve and thirteen thousand feet, arrayed in open ranks and
spiry pinnacled groups partially separated by tremendous canyons and
amphitheaters; gardens on their sunny brows, avalanches thundering
down their long white slopes, cataracts roaring gray and foaming in the
crooked, rugged gorges, and glaciers in their shadowy recesses, working
in silence, slowly completing their sculptures; new-born lakes at their feet,
blue and green, free or encumbered with drifting icebergs like miniature
Arctic Oceans, shining, sparkling, calm as stars.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">THE YOSEMITE VALLEY</span></h2>
<p>Little need be said of the Yosemite Valley. After these many years of
visitation and exploration it remains incomparable. It is often said that
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
the Sierra contains &ldquo;many Yosemites,&rdquo; but there is no other of its superabundance
of sheer beauty. It has been so celebrated in book and magazine
and newspaper that the Three Brothers, El Capitan, Bridalveil Fall,
Cathedral Spires, Mirror Lake, Half Dome, and Glacier Point are old
familiar friends to millions who have never seen them except in picture.</p>
<p>The Yosemite Valley was discovered in 1851 as an incidental result of
the effort to settle Indian problems which had arisen in that region. Dr.
L. H. Bunnel, a member of the expedition, suggested the appropriateness
of naming it after the aborigines who dwelt there. It rapidly became
celebrated.</p>

<p class="pcap">An unusual view of Yosemite Valley from the Nevada Fall Trail.</p>
</div>
<p>No matter what their expectation, most visitors are delightfully astonished
upon entering the Yosemite Valley. The sheer immensity of the precipices
on either side of the Valley&rsquo;s peaceful floor; the loftiness and the romantic
suggestion of the numerous waterfalls; the majesty of the granite walls;
and the unreal, almost fairy quality of the ever-varying whole cannot be
successfully foretold. The Valley is 7 miles long. Its floor averages 1 mile
in width, its walls rising from 3,000 to 4,000 feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h3 id="c2">HOW THE VALLEY WAS FORMED</h3>
<p>After the visitor has recovered from his first shock of astonishment&mdash;for it
is no less&mdash;at the beauty of the Valley, inevitably he wonders how nature
made it. How did it happen that walls so enormous rise so nearly perpendicular
from the level floor of the Valley?</p>
<p>When the Sierra Nevada was formed by the gradual tipping of a great
block of the earth&rsquo;s crust 400 miles long and 80 miles wide, streams draining
this block were pitched very definitely toward the west and with torrential
force cut deep canyons. The period of tipping and stream erosion covered
so many thousands of centuries that the Merced River was able to wear
away the sedimentary rocks several thousand feet in thickness, which
covered the granite and then in the Yosemite Valley region to cut some
2,000 feet into this very hard granite. Meantime the north and south
flowing side streams of the Merced, such as Yosemite Creek, not benefited
by the tipping of the Sierra block, could not cut as fast as their parent stream
and so were left high up as hanging valleys.</p>
<p>During the Ice Age great glaciers formed at the crest of the range and
flowed down these streams, cutting deep canyons and especially widening
them. At the maximum period the ice came within 700 feet of the top of
Half Dome. It overrode Glacier Point and extended perhaps a mile below
El Portal. Glaciers deepened Yosemite Valley 500 feet at the lower end
and 1,500 feet opposite Glacier Point; then widened it 1,000 feet at the
lower end and 3,600 feet in the upper half. The <span class="ss">V</span>-shaped canyon which
had resulted from stream erosion was now changed to a <span class="ss">U</span>-shaped trough;
the Yosemite Cataract was changed to Yosemite Fall. As the last glacier
melted back from the Valley a lake was formed, the filling in of which by
sediments has produced the practically level floor now found from El Capitan
to Half Dome.</p>
<p>Visitors to the park should join an auto caravan to study evidences first
hand and hear the story of the geology of Yosemite discussed by the
ranger-naturalists.</p>
<h3 id="c3">WATERFALLS</h3>
<p>The depth to which the Valley was cut by streams and glaciers is measured
roughly by the extraordinary height of the waterfalls which pour
over the rim.</p>
<p>The Upper Yosemite Fall, for instance, drops 1,430 feet in one sheer fall,
a height equal to nine Niagara Falls piled one on top of the other. The
Lower Yosemite Fall, immediately below, has a drop of 320 feet, or two
Niagaras more. Counting the series of cascades in between, the total drop
from the crest of Yosemite Fall to the Valley floor is 2,565 feet. Vernal Fall
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
has a drop of 317 feet; Illilouette Fall, 370 feet. The Nevada Fall drops 594
feet sheer; the celebrated Bridalveil Fall, 620 feet; while the Ribbon Fall,
highest of all, drops 1,612 feet sheer, a straight fall nearly 10 times as high as
Niagara. Nowhere else in the world may be seen a water spectacle such
as this.</p>
<p>The falls are at their fullest in May and June while the winter snows are
melting. They are still running in July, but after that decrease rapidly in
volume, Yosemite Fall often drying up entirely by August 15 when there
has been little rain or snow. But let it not be supposed that the beauty
of the falls depends upon the amount of water that pours over their brinks.
It is true that the May rush of water over the Yosemite Fall is even a little
appalling, when the ground sometimes trembles with it half a mile away,
but it is equally true that the spectacle of the Yosemite Fall in late July,
when, in specially dry seasons, much of the water reaches the bottom of
the upper fall in the form of mist, possesses a filmy grandeur that is not
comparable probably with any other sight in the world; the one inspires
by sheer bulk and power, the other uplifts by its intangible spirit of beauty.
To see the waterfalls at their best one should visit Yosemite before July 15.</p>

<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">GLACIER POINT AND THE RIM OF YOSEMITE VALLEY</span></h2>
<p>Glacier Point, above the Valley rim, commands a magnificent view of the
High Sierra. Spread before one in panorama are the domes, the pinnacles,
the waterfalls, and dominating all, Half Dome, a mythical Indian turned
to stone. A few steps from the hotel one looks down into Yosemite Valley,
3,254 feet below, where automobiles are but moving specks, tents white
dots, and the Merced River a silver tracery on green velvet. From the
little stone lookout, perched on the very rim of the gorge, by means of
high-powered binoculars installed for that purpose one may study the detail
of the High Sierra and its flanking ranges, miles distant, through a
sweep of 180&deg;, as though they were at his very feet. A ranger-naturalist is
here in summer to assist visitors and to discuss the geology, trees, birds, and
wildlife of Yosemite.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>No visitor should leave Yosemite without seeing Glacier Point. It is the
climax of all Yosemite views. It is reached by an excellent paved road
which leaves the Valley just west of Bridalveil Fall, and then through the
4,233-foot tunnel to Chinquapin, from which point a good oiled mountain
road leads through forests of fir and lodgepole pine to Glacier Point. The
total distance is 28 miles, or about 1&frac12; hours drive each way. The fire fall
is a nightly feature and takes on an entirely different aspect from the top
of the cliff. A short drive of a half mile from the main road above Glacier
Point brings one to Sentinel Dome, 8,117 feet in elevation, where an unobstructed
panorama of the southern half of the park may be had, from
the coast range on the west to the snow-capped ridge of the Sierra on the
east. A hotel, cafeteria, and Government camp ground are available at
Glacier Point.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">THE BIG TREES</span></h2>
<p>One of the best groves of giant sequoia trees outside of the Sequoia
National Park is found in the extreme south of the Yosemite National
Park and is called the Mariposa Grove. It is reached from the Wawona
Road, which enters the park from the south. From the Yosemite Valley
it is an easy drive of 35 miles over a paved, high-gear road requiring about
1&frac12; hours each way. Unsurpassed views of the whole expanse of Yosemite
Valley may be had from the east portal of the new 4,233-foot tunnel and,
from the Wawona Road, an extensive outlook over the South Fork Basin
and four or five ranges of foothills of the Sierra is a sight long to be remembered,
especially at sunset when the mountain ranges turn to many shades
of purple and gray.</p>
<p>All visitors to the Mariposa Grove should take the side trip to Glacier
Point, a distance of 16 miles each way, the road branching off at Chinquapin.
Here one may obtain an unsurpassed panorama of the High Sierra.</p>
<p>The new Big Trees Lodge in the upper grove is located in a beautiful
grove of sequoias, 20 to 30 feet in diameter, and affords excellent accommodations,
with cafeteria service available to all. The Government provides
a public camp ground near the entrance to the Big Tree Grove. Hotels
and camp grounds are also available at Wawona, 9 miles north of the grove
on the Wawona Road. Stages are run daily throughout the summer to
Glacier Point, Wawona, and Big Trees. Visitors to the grove are urged to
take plenty of time and really grasp the significance of these giant trees,
the oldest and largest living things on earth.</p>
<p>The Grizzly Giant is the oldest tree in the grove, with a base diameter of
27.6 feet, girth of 96.5 feet, and height of 209 feet. There is no accurate
way of knowing the age of the Grizzly Giant but its size and gnarled appearance
indicate that it is at least 3,800 years old.</p>
<p>A ranger-naturalist is on duty at the Big Trees Museum and gives talks
on the trees. Near the museum is the fallen Massachusetts tree, an
immense sequoia, 280 feet long and 28 feet in diameter, that was blown
over in the winter of 1927. As the tree is broken into several sections, it
provides a fine opportunity to study the rings and the character of the
wood. By climbing the length of this fallen tree one receives a graphic impression
of the size of these monarchs. In August 1934 another giant, the
&ldquo;Stable&rdquo; tree fell. It is located just above the museum. Visitors should
continue up the road to the famous tunnel tree, the Wawona, and drive
through the opening 8 feet wide that was cut in 1881. This tree is 231
feet tall and 27&frac12; feet in diameter. A little farther up the road a wonderful
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
view over the Wawona Basin and South Fork Canyon may be had at
Wawona Point, elevation 6,890 feet; especially fine are the views at sunset
from this point.</p>
<p>There are two other groves of Big Trees in Yosemite. The Tuolumne
Grove, located on the Big Oak Flat Road, 17 miles from the Valley, contains
some 25 very fine specimens and also a huge tree 29&frac12; feet in diameter
through which cars may be driven. The other grove, one of unusual
natural beauty in a secluded corner of the park, is the Merced Grove of
Big Trees, reached by a good dirt road. It is about 5 miles west of Crane
Flat off the Big Oak Flat Road.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">THE WAWONA BASIN</span></h2>
<p>The Wawona Basin of 14 square miles, added to the park in 1932, provides
an extensive area for recreational use. Here camping, riding, and
golfing may be enjoyed in a perfect setting along the South Fork of the
Merced River. Wawona is located in a beautiful mountain meadow on the
new Wawona Road, 27 miles south of the Valley and near the Mariposa
Grove of Big Trees. Superb views are obtainable from many points on
this road, which leaves the Valley just west of Bridalveil Fall. Saddle and
pack animals are available at popular prices for trips to the fine fishing lakes
and streams in the southern part of the park. There are also tennis courts
and swimming pools. The Wawona Hotel provides both European and
American plan service, and operates a coffee shop. Stores, meat market,
garage, gas station, and post office are available, and along the river near
Wawona is a free camp ground. An emergency airplane landing field is
located near the Wawona Hotel.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">HETCH HETCHY VALLEY</span></h2>
<p>A good oiled mountain road makes the scenic Hetch Hetchy Valley a
short, 2-hour drive by car from Yosemite Valley, a distance of 38 miles
each way over the Big Oak Flat Road. This road is a 1-way control
road for the first 4 miles after it leaves the Valley near El Capitan. This
one-way section is a road of rare charm and beauty with superb views
over the Valley. It passes through fine stands of Sugar Pine and Red
Fir and the Tuolumne Grove of Big Trees. The road continues on through
one of the finest stands of sugar pine left in the world.</p>
<p>A fine paved road extends from Mather down to the Hetch Hetchy Dam,
a distance of 9 miles, where one may see San Francisco&rsquo;s gigantic 300-foot
Hetch Hetchy Dam and water supply. The valley is similar to Yosemite,
with tumbling waterfalls and precipitous cliffs surrounding a lake 7 miles
long. The San Francisco Recreation Camp is located at Mather, near the
park line.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Visitors using the Big Oak Flat Road are urged to see the wonderful
panorama of the High Sierra from the fire look-out tower, 1&frac12; miles over an
oiled road just west of Crane Flat. The fire guard on duty will be glad to
explain the points of interest and show visitors how fires are located and
put under control.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">TUOLUMNE MEADOWS</span></h2>
<p>John Muir, in describing the upper Tuolumne region, writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the heart of the High Sierra, 8,500 to 9,000 feet above the level of the sea. The
gray picturesque Cathedral Range bounds it on the south; a similar range or spur, the
highest peak of which is Mount Conness, on the north; the noble Mounts Dana, Gibbs,
Mammoth, Lyell, Maclure, and others on the axis of the range on the east; a heavy
billowy crowd of glacier-polished rocks and Mount Hoffmann on the west. Down
through the open sunny meadow levels of the Valley flows the Tuolumne River, fresh
and cool from its many glacial fountains, the highest of which are the glaciers that lie
on the north side of Mount Lyell and Mount Maclure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A store, gas station, garage, post office, camp ground, High Sierra Camp,
and Tuolumne Meadows Lodge make the Meadows an ideal high-mountain
camping place and starting point for fishing, hiking, and mountain-climbing
trips. Tuolumne Meadows is 67 miles or about a 4-hour drive
over the Big Oak Flat and Tioga Roads from Yosemite Valley. Saddle
horses are available, and many fine trips may be made to Waterwheel
Falls, Mount Lyell, Mount Conness, Glen Aulin, Muir Gorge, and hundreds
of good fishing lakes and streams. Stage service to Tuolumne Meadows,
Tioga Pass, Mono Lake, and Lake Tahoe is maintained daily throughout
the summer months.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/pmg05.jpg" alt="" width="912" height="500" />
<p class="pcap">Lambert Dome and Mount Dana are conspicuous landmarks of Tuolumne Meadows.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>Fishing is usually very good in nearby lakes and streams. The Waterwheel
Falls, Muir Gorge, the Soda Springs, the spectacular canyon scenery,
jewel-like Tenaya Lake, and the Mount Lyell Glacier are a few of the interesting
places to visit near Tuolumne Meadows.</p>
<p>John Muir writes this interesting description of the Grand Canyon of the
Tuolumne and Waterwheel Falls:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the cascades or sloping falls on the main river that are the crowning glory of the
canyon, and these, in volume, extent, and variety, surpass those of any other canyon in
the Sierra. The most showy and interesting of them are mostly in the upper part of the
canyon above the point of entrance of Cathedral Creek and Hoffmann Creek. For
miles the river is one wild, exulting, onrushing mass of snowy purple bloom, spreading
over glacial waves of granite without any definite channel, gliding in magnificent silver
plumes, dashing and foaming through huge boulder dams, leaping high in the air in
wheel-like whirls, displaying glorious enthusiasm, tossing from side to side, doubling,
glinting, singing in exuberance of mountain energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Muir&rsquo;s &ldquo;wheel-like whirls&rdquo; undoubtedly mean the celebrated Waterwheel
Falls. Rushing down the canyon&rsquo;s slanting granites under great headway,
the river encounters shelves of rock projecting from its bottom. From
these, enormous arcs of solid water are thrown high in the air. Some of
the waterwheels rise 20 feet and span 50 feet in the arc. Unfortunately,
the amount of water in the river drops with the advance of summer and
the waterwheels lose much of their forcefulness. Visitors should see this
spectacle during the period of high water from June 15 to August 1 in
normal years.</p>
<p>The Waterwheel Falls may be reached by a good trail 5.5 miles from the
Tioga Road down the Tuolumne River Gorge to the Glen Aulin High
Sierra Camp, where meals and overnight accommodations are available,
then 2.8 miles down the river to Waterwheel Falls. Saddle animals may be
rented at Tuolumne Meadows for this trip.</p>
<p>Below the waterwheels the Tuolumne Canyon descends abruptly, the
river plunging madly through the mile-deep gorge. Trails built a few
years ago down the canyon from the Waterwheel Falls to Pate Valley
penetrate the very heart of the gorge. The Muir Gorge, a vertical-walled
cleft in the canyon a half mile deep, is, as a result, but 2 hours below
Waterwheel Falls and the same above Pate Valley by the new trails. The
entire canyon may be traversed with ease either on horseback or on foot.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">PATE VALLEY</span></h2>
<p>A few miles farther westward the granite heights slope back more gently
and the river suddenly pauses in its tumultuous course to meander through
the pines and oaks and cedars of a meadowed flat. Pate Valley has been
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
known for years from the reports of venturesome knapsackers, but now it
is made accessible by one of the best trails in the park.</p>
<p>An unnatural smoky blackening of the overhanging cornices of the 200-foot
walls almost surrounding the glade leads one to approach them, and
there, near the ground, are hundreds of Indian pictographs. These are
mysterious, fantastic, and unreadable, but the deep-red stain is as clearly
defined as on the day that the red man set down tales of his great hunt, or of
famine, or of war, or perhaps of his gods. Here, too, obsidian chips tell the
story of preparation for war and the chase, and sharp eyes are rewarded
by the sight of many a perfect spear point or arrowhead.</p>
<p>Atop a huge shaded talus block are many bowl-shaped holes, a primitive
gristmill where once the squaws ground acorns for their pounded bread,
which was the staff of life for so many California tribes. Blackened cooking
rocks may be found, and numerous stone pestles lying about in this and
two or three similar places seem to point to a hurried departure, but the
&ldquo;when&rdquo; and &ldquo;why&rdquo; of this exodus still remain a mystery.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">THE NORTHERN CANYONS</span></h2>
<p>North of the Tuolumne River is an enormous area of lakes and valleys
which are seldom visited, notwithstanding that it is penetrated by numerous
trails. It is a wilderness of wonderful charm and deserves to harbor a
thousand camps. The trout fishing in many of these waters is unsurpassed.</p>
<p>Though unknown to people generally, this superb Yosemite country
north of the Valley has been the haunt for many years of the confirmed
mountain lovers of the Pacific coast. It has been the favorite resort of the
Sierra Club during many years of summer outings.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">THE MOUNTAIN CLIMAX OF THE SIERRA</span></h2>
<p>The monster mountain mass, of which Mount Lyell, 13,090 feet high, is
the chief, lies on the eastern boundary of the park. It may be reached by
trail from Tuolumne Meadows and is well worth the journey. It is the
climax of the Sierra in this neighborhood.</p>
<p>The traveler swings from the Tuolumne Meadows around Johnson Peak
to Lyell Fork and turns southward up its valley. Huge Kuna Crest borders
the trail&rsquo;s left side for miles. At the head of the Valley, beyond several
immense granite shelves, rears the mighty group, Mount Lyell in the center,
supported on the north by Mount Maclure and on the south by Rodgers
Peak.</p>
<p>The way up is through a vast basin of tumbled granite, encircled at its
climax by a titanic rampart of nine sharp, glistening peaks and hundreds
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
of spear-like points, the whole usually cloaked in enormous sweeping shrouds
of snow. Presently the granite spurs inclose one. And directly, beyond
these, looms a mighty wall of glistening granite which apparently forbids
further approach to the mountain&rsquo;s shrine. But another half hour brings
one face to face with Lyell&rsquo;s rugged top and shining glacier, one of the
noblest high places in America. Mount Dana, with its glacier and great
variety of alpine flowers, can be climbed in one day from Tuolumne Meadows
and now offers a very popular hiking trip.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">MERCED AND WASHBURN LAKES</span></h2>
<p>The waters from the western slopes of Lyell and Maclure find their way,
through many streams and many lakelets of splendid beauty, into two
lakes which are the headwaters of the famous Merced River. The upper
of these is Washburn Lake, cradled in bare heights and celebrated for its
fishing. This is the formal source of the Merced. Several miles below,
the river rests again in beautiful Merced Lake.</p>
<p>One of the six Yosemite High Sierra camps is at the head of Merced Lake.
There is a new trail 13 miles from Yosemite Valley to Merced Lake which
crosses glacier-polished slopes. It is real wilderness, famous for its good
fishing and beautiful scenery.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CLIMATE AND SEASONS</span></h2>
<p>This land of enchantments is a land of enchanted climate. Its summers
are warm, but not too warm; dry, but not too dry; its nights cool and marvelously
starry. Moonlight on the towering granite walls is unsurpassed in
its romantic beauty.</p>
<p>It is a land of sunshine. It is a land of inspiring, often sublime scenery.
It is the ideal camping-out ground. Rain seldom falls in the Yosemite
between May and October. In winter Yosemite Valley is transformed into
a snowy fairyland and all sorts of winter sports may be enjoyed. The
weather is mild and sunny most of the time. To many, winter is the finest
season in Yosemite. In addition to the toboggans, skating, dog teams, and
other winter sports available in the Valley from December 1 to March 1,
unlimited areas for snow sports and skiing are now accessible from the new
Wawona Road which is open most of the winter.</p>
<p>Spring in Yosemite is most refreshing and exhilarating. It rarely rains
and is seldom even cloudy. The falls are at their best; the azalea bushes,
which grow to man&rsquo;s height, blossom forth in flowers exquisite as orchids.
The latter part of April or the early part of May the lodges and camps are
opened, tents are pitched along the river, and before one knows it summer
has arrived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>In this season Yosemite has an irresistible appeal. There is every form
of enjoyment available. One may live in a lodge, where the honk of an
automobile is never heard and where a full day&rsquo;s catch of trout is assured
from nearby lake or stream; one may live in a hotel where mountain
scenery is unsurpassed; or one may live in the Valley and enjoy swimming,
hiking, nature trips, auto caravans, evening programs, motor trips, fishing,
dancing, tennis, golf, and many other forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>Autumn is intensified in the Yosemite. All is quiet. The falls are silent
and only a few people and machines are encountered. Nature is supreme.
The changing leaves of the dogwood, azaleas, and quaking aspens form a
brilliant assortment of colors.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">WINTER SPORTS</span></h2>
<p>Yosemite Valley is unusually beautiful in winter, when the fresh snowfalls
transform it into a white fairyland and sunset paints the cliffs and domes
with rosy alpine glow.</p>
<p>John Muir, in describing the ice cone of the Yosemite Fall, writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The frozen spray (of the fall) gives rise to one of the most interesting winter features of
the Valley&mdash;a cone of ice at the foot of the fall 400 or 500 feet high. * * * When the
cone is in the process of formation, growing higher and wider in frosty weather, it looks
like a beautiful, smooth, pure white hill.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/pmg06.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="408" />
<p class="pcap">Winter sports enthusiasts enjoy unexcelled mountain scenery in the high country.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The All-Year Highway is open and in good condition every day during
the winter months and the Government maintains the roads in safe condition
so that chains are not ordinarily needed. It is, however, advisable
to carry chains in case they are needed during heavy storms. Information
on snow sports and winter road conditions may be obtained at automobile
associations. It is advisable to make reservations for rooms on Saturday
nights and holidays from December 25 to February 25.</p>
<p>The Wawona Road to the Big Trees is open most of the winter except
during periods of unusually heavy snowfall. There are unlimited snow
fields for skiing and other snow sports along the Wawona Road, accessible
through the tunnel.</p>
<p>The Valley, inclosed by granite walls which shut out the winds, has a
mild and balmy winter climate. In fact, these walls really provide two
distinct winter climates on opposite sides of the Valley, the north side being
many degrees warmer than the south. On the northern side one may
motor, ride horseback, and hike in comfort, while on the southern side,
screened from the sun by the towering cliffs, all the popular winter sports
prevail. Under the auspices of the Yosemite Winter Club, ice hockey
matches, curling, fancy costume skating carnivals, snow figure contests,
ski-joring races, skating gymkhanas, figure skating exhibitions, Eskimo dog
races, and other winter sports events are held throughout the winter season,
which usually lasts from December until March.</p>
<p>Competent instructors on the Yosemite Winter Club staff provide group
and individual instruction in skiing and plain and fancy skating. Winter
sports equipment and clothing may be rented reasonably in the Valley.</p>
<p>The National Park Service maintains a popular free snowslide for the
enjoyment of the public. It is called &ldquo;Ash Can Alley&rdquo;, because the trip
down the slide is made in heavy tin pans that resemble ash-can covers.</p>
<p>Skiing enthusiasts may enjoy excursions of several days&rsquo; duration in the
high mountain country above Yosemite Valley accompanied by a ski
instructor and guide and stopping overnight at ski lodges strategically
located at an elevation where the snow is deep throughout the winter and
in a region where the ski fields are second to none. Skiing is also enjoyed
on ski fields along Wawona Road and adjacent to Glacier Point on the rim
of the Valley, reached on foot over a 4-mile trail. The Glacier Point
Mountain House is kept open during the winter season.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">TRAILS AND HIKES</span></h2>
<p>With nearly 700 miles of well-defined trails radiating from Yosemite
Valley to all sections of the park, and with, for the most part, camps, lodges,
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
or hotels situated within an easy day&rsquo;s walking distance from each other,
conditions in Yosemite are particularly adapted to hiking trips. The hiker
may go &ldquo;light&rdquo;, depending upon the hotels and lodges for accommodations,
or he may pack his entire outfit either on his back or upon a pack
animal and thereby be entirely independent. During July and August
ranger-naturalists conduct regular 7-day hikes through the High Sierra,
stopping each night at one of the High Sierra camps above mentioned.
There is no charge for this guide service, but hikers desiring to go with
these guides should register at the museum in advance.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">FISHING</span></h2>
<p>The introduction of game fish into the waters of Yosemite National Park
began in 1878, 12 years before the area now confined within the park
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
boundaries had been set aside as a national reservation, when plants of
rainbow trout were made in some of the lakes in what is now the northwestern
corner of the park. In the following year plants of eastern brook
trout were made in the Lyell Fork of the Tuolumne River, and in 1880
plants of rainbow trout were repeated in the Lake Eleanor country.
Nothing more seems to have been done in the way of stocking any of the
waters that are now within the park until 1890, the year that the park was
created, when a general stocking of the streams and lakes was begun. This
was continued, at first intermittently, but from 1911 to 1925 plants of from
100,000 to 400,000 young fry were made annually. The State hatchery
was completed at Happy Isles in 1926 and from that year from 500,000 to
over 1,000,000 fry have been planted annually by the rangers, with the
result that today all of the principal lakes and streams of the park contain
one or more well-known species of game fish.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/pmg07.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="468" />
<p class="pcap">Landing a big one from Elizabeth Lake near Tuolumne Meadows.</p>
</div>
<p>It is in the northern canyons, however, that the greatest of all fishing
grounds in the entire park are found. Many of the waters of that great
area of 500 square miles or more north of the Tuolumne River were stocked
years ago with rainbow and eastern brook. Conditions for continued
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
propagation seem to have been exceedingly favorable, with the result that
practically all of the lakes and streams now teem with fish life, and the
fisherman who seeks fishing de luxe amid surroundings of the most fascinating
grandeur of high-mountain scenery will find here a fulfillment of
his most ambitious dreams and will be more than repaid for having taken
time to penetrate this portion of the park.</p>
<p>In Yosemite National Park few anglers, even the most inexperienced, use
bait during the summer or autumn. Of the various artificial flies the California
Royal Coachman almost always proves the best lure; gray and
brown hackles are also very good. Copper-nickel spinners of the sizes 0 to
2 are often taken in the lakes and sometimes in the streams when the trout
are not rising to flies.</p>
<p>The nine species of trout in the waters of the park, about in the order of
their relative abundance, are: Eastern brook trout, rainbow trout, brown
trout, Lock Leven trout, cutthroat or black-spotted trout, Tahoe trout,
steelhead trout, golden trout.</p>
<p>Information on the best lakes and streams for fishing may be obtained at
any ranger station or at park headquarters in the New Village. See
posted weekly bulletins.</p>
<p>Persons desiring to fish in the waters of Yosemite National Park must secure
a sporting fishing license, as required by the laws of California. These
laws provide that every person over the age of 18 years who obtains fish
without first taking out a license is guilty of a misdemeanor. The license
fee for residents is $2; for nonresidents, $3; and for aliens, $5. These
licenses may be obtained from any county clerk, from the State Board of
Fish and Game Commissioners, Wawona, Carl Inn, and Tuolumne
Meadows, or at the general store in Yosemite Village. All fishing must
be done in conformity with the State laws regarding open season, size of
fish, and limit of catch.</p>

<h3 id="c20">BY AUTOMOBILE</h3>
<p><b>All-Year State Highway.</b>&mdash;The main paved route to Yosemite Valley
from all California points, both north and south, is through Merced
on the Pacific Highway through the San Joaquin Valley (Route 99).
From Merced the State maintains the splendid paved All-Year Highway
to El Portal (Route 140) and from El Portal the National Park Service
maintains a similar highway to Yosemite Valley. It is 83 miles long and
is the shortest, easiest, and most popular route from Merced, a high-gear
modern highway, requiring 2&frac12; hours to drive from Merced to Yosemite
Valley. It is open and safely traveled every day of the year.</p>
<p>During the winter months visitors may obtain the latest accurate information
on the snow conditions and winter sports at the automobile association
offices. Visit the quaint old town of Mariposa, center of the gold
rush in the days of &rsquo;49. See the oldest courthouse in the State, built in 1854.</p>
<p><b>By Seasonal Mountain Roads.</b>&mdash;There are two other main routes
across the Yosemite National Park leading into the Yosemite Valley, viz,
the Wawona Road from the south and the Big Oak Flat Road from the
north. The Tioga Road crosses the center of the park from east to west
and connects with the Big Oak Flat Road. The Wawona Road is reached
from Fresno, Madera, or Merced and points south and west of the park.
The Big Oak Flat Road may be reached from Stockton, Modesto, Oakdale,
and points north and west of the park. The Tioga Road may be
reached on the east at Mono Lake from Lake Tahoe and points north,
from Tonopah, Nev., and points east, from Bishop, Big Pine, and Mojave,
and points south. On the west it connects with the Big Oak Flat Road
at Carl Inn. Motorists using these roads will experience no serious difficulty
if their cars are in good condition. In wet weather chains are
advisable.</p>

<p><b>The Tioga Road.</b>&mdash;Up the east slope of the Sierra Nevadas, through the
scenic, spectacular Leevining Canyon, and from east to west across the
mountain-top paradise winds the Tioga Road, which has a romantic
history. It was built by Chinese labor in 1881 to a gold mine east of the
park, but as the mine did not pay the expenses of getting out the ore it was
quickly abandoned and soon became impassable. In 1915 a group of
public-spirited citizens, headed by the Honorable Stephen T. Mather,
purchased it from the present owners of the old mining property and presented
it to the Government. When a young man, Mark Twain visited
Mono Lake on the Tioga Road. Following is his own inimitable description
from Roughing It:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mono Lake is a hundred miles in a straight line from the ocean&mdash;and between it and
the ocean are one or two ranges of mountains&mdash;yet thousands of sea gulls go there every
season to lay their eggs and rear their young. One would as soon expect to find sea gulls
in Kansas. And in this connection let us observe another instance of nature&rsquo;s wisdom.
The islands in the lake being merely huge masses of lava, coated over with ashes and
pumice stone, and utterly innocent of vegetation or anything that would burn; and sea
gulls&rsquo; eggs being entirely useless to anyone unless they be cooked, nature has provided
an unfailing spring of boiling water on the largest island, and you can put your eggs in
there, and in 4 minutes you can boil them as hard as any statement I have made during
the past 15 years. Within 10 feet of the boiling spring is a spring of pure, cold water,
sweet and wholesome. So in that island you get your board and washing free of charge&mdash;and
if nature had gone farther and furnished a nice American hotel clerk, who was
crusty and disobliging, and didn&rsquo;t know anything about the time-tables, or the railroad
routes&mdash;or&mdash;anything&mdash;and was proud of it&mdash;I would not wish for a more desirable
boarding house.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="c21">BY RAILROAD AND AUTO STAGE</h3>
<p>Merced is the most popular railway and stage gateway to the park and
is served by the Southern Pacific Railway, the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa
Fe Railway, and stage lines.</p>
<p>At Merced, direct connections are made throughout the year with daily
trains of the Yosemite Valley Railroad to El Portal, at which place passengers
are transferred to stages on the last 14 miles to Yosemite Valley. In
summer, through overnight sleeper cars from San Francisco and Los
Angeles are available for train passengers daily. For information regarding
schedules, rates, etc., visit your nearest ticket office or write to the passenger
traffic manager of the Southern Pacific Lines, San Francisco, Calif.,
the Santa Fe Lines, Chicago, Ill., or the Yosemite Valley Railroad, Merced,
Calif.</p>
<p>Automobile stages from Merced to Yosemite Valley are operated every
day of the year. In summer, stages leave Fresno and Stockton for Yosemite
Valley, the service being available daily from about June 1 to September 1.
From July 4 to September 3, stages connect Yosemite Valley and Lake
Tahoe with daily service via the Tioga Road. For information and rates,
apply to the Yosemite Transportation System, Yosemite National Park,
Calif.</p>
<h3 id="c22">BY AIRPLANE</h3>
<p>For persons desiring to spend less time en route to the park, fast air service
is available to Fresno, Calif. This is furnished by the United Air
Lines on their Seattle to San Diego route, which connects with their
transcontinental planes at Oakland and those of the American Airlines
and TWA at Los Angeles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">ADMINISTRATION</span></h2>
<p>The representative of the National Park Service in immediate charge of
Yosemite National Park is the superintendent, C. G. Thomson, whose
office is located in the Administration Building in the Yosemite New Village
and whose address is Yosemite National Park, Calif. General information
may be obtained from him, and all complaints should be addressed
to him. A staff of employees, including rangers and ranger-naturalists,
assists the superintendent in serving the public.</p>
<p>Exclusive jurisdiction over Yosemite National Park was ceded to the
United States by act of the California Legislature, dated April 15, 1919,
and accepted by Congress by act approved June 2, 1920 (41 Stat. 731).</p>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">INFORMATION BUREAU</span></h2>
<p>The National Park Service maintains an information bureau at the
superintendent&rsquo;s office in Yosemite New Village, and the ranger in charge
will supply accurate information concerning points of interest, trails, camping
facilities, camping locations, fishing places, etc.</p>
<p>A branch office of the California State Automobile Association is maintained
in conjunction with the Park Service Information Bureau, where
the best road information obtainable is furnished free to autoists.</p>
<p>Information can also be obtained at the museum or at any of the hotels,
camps, lodges, or garages, and at the transportation offices.</p>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">FREE EDUCATIONAL SERVICE</span></h2>
<p>Constant improvement of the roads makes Yosemite more and more
readily accessible. Every class of accommodation is provided for the comfort
of the tourist. But the National Park Service has carried the idea of
service to a still higher point in providing a free nature-guide service. In
other words, the visitor is encouraged to avail himself of the offices of
an interpreter in the form of a trained ranger-naturalist who can answer his
questions and reveal the many fascinations of nature which abound on
every side. To enjoy fully a national-park trip, one must learn to read the
trails.</p>
<p>During the summer season a splendid program of lectures and nature-guide
service is offered to visitors. One should plan to take advantage of
the lectures and trips listed below which are available only during the
long summer season. During winter months the modified program consists
mainly of lectures at the hotels and the museum. The more the visitor
knows about the park and its wildlife the more he will enjoy his stay.
This service is maintained by the Government and is free to the public.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Nature walks from Camp Curry each morning (except Sunday).</p>
<p>Special bird walks at 8 o&rsquo;clock each Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Auto caravans each day at 9:30 a. m. and 2 p. m. (except Sunday) to
points of special interest on the floor of the Valley. These start from
museum, visitors using their own cars.</p>
<p>Each day (except Sunday) there is an all-day hike to Glacier Point, Vernal
and Nevada Falls, Eagle Peak, Tenaya Canyon, or Half Dome.</p>
<p>At the evening camp-fire program at Government Camp No. 14, Camp
Curry, Yosemite Lodge, and the Ahwahnee Hotel there are short talks on
wildlife.</p>
<p>Short talks on the geology of Yosemite Valley are given several times each
morning and afternoon in the museum.</p>
<p>Each week a naturalist leads a party on a 7-day hike into the spectacular
high mountain region of the park, starting from Happy Isles at 7:30 o&rsquo;clock
each Monday morning. Make reservations in advance at the museum.</p>
<p>A junior nature school for children is conducted during the summer.</p>
<p>The bears are fed every evening at 9:30 o&rsquo;clock at the bear pits, and a
short talk is given on animal life of the Yosemite.</p>
<p>Groups or organizations may procure the services of a naturalist by applying
to the park naturalist at the museum.</p>
<h3 id="c26">MUSEUM</h3>
<p>The park museum, in New Village, a gift to the Nation from the Laura
Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, is a spacious and appropriately designed
building in which are housed a large number of exhibits loaned or contributed
by park enthusiasts.</p>
<p>These exhibits are appropriately displayed in rooms devoted to the following
major fields: Geology, birds and animals, Indian history, trees, and
flowers.</p>
<p>The museum grounds have recently been beautified by plantings of
native wild flowers and shrubs, a project made possible by a gift from
Marjorie Montgomery Ward. Flower lovers will find this garden a great
aid in identifying flowers that they have seen along the roads and trails.</p>
<p>An Indian exhibit is conducted back of the museum daily during the summer
by inhabitants of the local Indian village.</p>
<p>The museum also contains a library well supplied with scientific and historical
books and periodicals, all of which are available to visitors.</p>
<p>Naturalists at the museum are at the service of the public to answer questions
and to instruct regarding the park and its wildlife.</p>

<h3 id="c27">YOSEMITE FIELD SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY</h3>
<p>A 7 weeks&rsquo; course in field study of Sierra Nevada natural history is
offered by the Yosemite educational staff to students who have completed at
least 2 years of college work. Emphasis is placed upon field methods,
and the course is designed to avoid duplication of work offered in universities
and colleges.</p>
<h3 id="c28">RANGER-NATURALIST OUTPOST</h3>
<p>The development of the park areas above the rim has inevitably brought
with it the establishment of branch-museum and ranger-naturalist service
at several focal points of interest.</p>
<p>The Glacier Point Lookout is located on the most famed scenic point on
the rim. Powerful binoculars enable visitors to bring the Sierra&rsquo;s great
peaks to their very feet. A flower show is maintained, and a ranger-naturalist
on duty conducts a service of field trips and lectures which
correlate with those offered from the Yosemite Museum.</p>
<p>At Mariposa Grove the old log cabin originally built by Galen Clark
and replaced by the State in 1885 has been reconstructed. This is now
equipped as a museum telling the complete story of the Big Trees. A
ranger-naturalist is stationed here to lecture, make guide trips to famous
trees, sell publications, and give accurate information.</p>
<p>At Tuolumne Meadows a ranger-naturalist is stationed during July and
August to conduct field trips, organize more strenuous mountain-climbing
expeditions, keep up an exhibit of local interest, and lecture at evening
camp fires.</p>
<p>Guide maps, and topographical maps may be obtained from the ranger-naturalists,
who will be glad to assist visitors desiring to know more about
the park.</p>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="small">ACCOMMODATIONS FOR VISITORS</span></h2>
<p>Accommodations in Yosemite National Park offer a complete range from
free public camp grounds to the highest class of hotel service. At all units
except housekeeping there is a discount of 10 percent from the basic rates

<h3 id="c30">FREE PUBLIC CAMP GROUNDS</h3>
<p>The National Park Service maintains extensive camp grounds in Yosemite
Valley and at Glacier Point, Mariposa Grove, and Tuolumne Meadows,
for the use of which no charge is made. These areas are provided
with necessary sanitary conveniences and for the most part with running
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
water. The grounds are policed daily during the camping season and all
litter and waste removed.</p>
<p>A camp-fire entertainment is held each summer evening (except Sunday)
at a platform centrally located in Camp 14. Please report any talent
among the campers to the ranger at entrance to Camp 14.</p>
<p>The public is requested to cooperate with the park force in keeping the
camp grounds clean and presentable.</p>
<p>Campers must register their name, address, car make and number,
length of stay and location in camp ground (post and section number) on
the registration book at entrance to each camp ground. This is important
in case of emergency messages.</p>
<h3 id="c31">HOTELS, LODGES, HOUSEKEEPING CABINS, AND CAMPS</h3>

<p><b>Important Notice.</b>&mdash;The closing of schools in California always
brings a rush of visitors to the park immediately after June 15 and from
that date to July 25 prospective visitors to the park (except those contemplating
camping with their own outfits in the free public camping grounds)
should in all cases apply in advance for reservations. Advance reservations
for the period between December 28 and January 1 will not be made for

<p>Rates authorized herein are subject to change without notice on approval
by the Director of the National Park Service. Authorized changes in rates
will be posted for public information in the park.</p>

or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
